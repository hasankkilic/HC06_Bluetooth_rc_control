# HC06_Bluetooth_rc_control
We control the car by sending a signal via the phone with the HC-06 Bluetooth module. I placed everything on the PCB card I made; you can create a special tool for yourself by examining the codes. My purpose in making this tool is to learn electronic PCB design and integrate various sensors into a card. For example, this tool is equipped with various sensors such as line tracking and maze solving, but in the current code, it is only used for Bluetooth control.
